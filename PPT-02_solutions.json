When two surfaces are in relative motion, the friction force on each surface opposes its motion relative to the other surface. Reason R is TRUE.\n\n \nExamining the relationship: Reason R directly explains Assertion A. The reason friction does negative work (A) is precisely because it opposes the relative motion (R). Since friction acts opposite to the direction of displacement, the angle between the friction force and displacement is $180^\\circ$, making the work negative.
